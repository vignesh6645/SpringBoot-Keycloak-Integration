# Keycloak Integration with Spring Boot Application

 # What is Keycloak and Why Do We Use It?
 Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution developed by Red Hat. It provides robust authentication, authorization, and Single 
 Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for web applications and services. Keycloak simplifies user management, centralizes security policies, and secures your 
 application through various authentication methods, including username/password, social login, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

 Keycloak offers several benefits, including:
  1. Centralized Authentication
  2. Single Sign-On (SSO)
  3. Security and Compliance
  4. Social Login Integration
  5. Open Standards

# Single Sign-On (SSO):
Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication mechanism that allows users to log in once and access multiple applications or services without the need to re-authenticate for each application. SSO enhances user experience and productivity by reducing the number of login prompts and simplifying user access.

# SSO Protocols

# SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):
 SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, typically an identity provider (IdP) and a service 
 provider (SP). It enables web-based SSO and is commonly used in enterprise environments.

 # OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization):
 OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's account on behalf of the user. It is 
 widely used for granting access to APIs and services.

 # OpenID Connect (OIDC):
  OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. It provides user authentication and identity information through a standardized set 
  of endpoints. OIDC allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

  # Why OpenID Connect is Best Suited for Spring Boot Applications
   OpenID Connect is well-suited for Spring Boot applications due to the following reasons:

   1. Spring Security Integration: Spring Security, the de facto security framework for Spring applications, provides excellent support for integrating 
      with OpenID Connect, making it easier to implement OIDC-based authentication in Spring Boot projects.
   2. Standardization and Interoperability: OpenID Connect is an industry-standard protocol widely adopted by major IAM providers, ensuring seamless 
      integration with various identity providers, including Keycloak.
   3. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Support: OIDC uses JWTs to represent identity and authentication information, and Spring Boot has robust support for JWT 
      processing, making it convenient to handle and verify tokens.                               

 # Keycloak Terminology
  This section can provide a brief introduction to some key terms used in Keycloak, setting the context for the subsequent explanations.

  # 1. Realm
  •	A realm is a security domain in Keycloak. It acts as a container for a set of users, roles, and groups, as well as the authentication and 
    authorization configurations that define how users can log in and access resources within that realm.
  •	Each Keycloak server can have multiple realms, and they are isolated from each other. Users from one realm cannot access or authenticate in another 
    realm.
   # 2. Client:
  • A client in Keycloak represents a web application, service, or resource that needs to be secured by Keycloak. It could be a frontend web 
    application, a backend API, or a mobile app.
  • When you integrate Keycloak with your application, you need to create a client in the Keycloak realm for that application. The client configuration 
    defines how the application interacts with Keycloak for authentication and authorization.
   # 3. Client Scope:
   • A client scope is a set of permissions or claims that define the access that a client has. It represents the set of permissions that a client can 
     request from the Keycloak server during the authentication process.
   • Clients can request specific client scopes to define the level of access they need. For example, a client may request a "read" scope to access 
     certain resources and a "write" scope for additional permissions to modify data.
   # 4. Client Secret:
   • A client secret is a confidential value known only to the client and the Keycloak server. It is used to authenticate the client when making requests 
     to Keycloak's token endpoint.
   • When you create a client in Keycloak, you can generate a client secret, and the client must include this secret in its requests when obtaining access 
     tokens.

  # Configuration:

  1. Using Keycloak official site you can download and install the keycloak.
  2. After installing the keycloak unzip and go the bin folder and open the command prompt and enter the below command

         kc.bat start-dev --http-port [port_number]
   3. After running the keycloak u can go and create the admin login in dashboard

          localhost:[port_number]
   4. Inside the dashboard you can create realm, client and user details
   5.  Using token url you can generate token

           http://localhost:8181/realms/[your_realm]/protocol/openid-connect/token
       payload:

            grant_type:password
            client_id:[your_client_id]
            username:[your_user_name]
            password:[your_password]
   6. For the Resource Server setup you will follow the below link

# Conclusion
 Keycloak integration with Spring Boot brings robust authentication, authorization, and SSO capabilities to your application. By leveraging the power of 
 OpenID Connect, you can ensure secure and seamless authentication for your users.
